## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm passionate about creativity, design, and building thingsâ€”whether it's with code, pixels, or bricks.  
Here are a few things that define me:

- ðŸ‘Ÿ **Sneakers** â€“ I'm a sneakerhead at heart. I follow drops, collect pairs, and sometimes sketch my own concepts.
- ðŸ§± **LEGO Bricks** â€“ A childhood love that never left. I enjoy building both physical sets and digital MOCs (My Own Creations).
- ðŸ’» **Computer Graphics** â€“ From logos to 3D renders, I love bringing ideas to life visually.
